CP Roadmap by chatGPT

#1:
Familiarize yourself with Codeforces (0-1 month): Start by exploring the Codeforces website and getting familiar with its interface and the types of problems it offers. Familiarize yourself with the problem-solving process and the steps involved in submitting a solution.

Basic programming concepts (1-2 months): Before diving into competitive programming, it is important to have a strong foundation in basic programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and time complexity. You can start with online resources such as Codecademy, LeetCode, or Coursera to learn the basics of programming and data structures.

Mathematics for Competitive Programming (2-3 months): A solid understanding of mathematics is essential for competitive programming. Focus on topics such as number theory, combinatorics, linear algebra, and graph theory. You can use resources such as Khan Academy, MathWorld, and Brilliant.org to deepen your understanding of these topics.

Data Structures (3-4 months): This is an important topic in competitive programming. Start by learning the basics of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Once you have a solid understanding of these data structures, move on to more advanced topics such as balanced trees (AVL, red-black), and segment trees.

Algorithms (4-5 months): Start with the basics of algorithms such as sorting, searching, and traversal algorithms. Then, move on to more advanced topics such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, dijkstra, floyd warshall, kruskal).

Practice (5 months and beyond): The key to becoming a master in competitive programming is consistent practice. Participate in Codeforces rounds, solve problems on LeetCode, and attend online contests to put your skills to the test. Read editorials and solutions from other users to learn from their approaches and improve your own problem-solving skills.

Advanced topics (6 months and beyond): Once you have a solid foundation in basic programming concepts, mathematics, data structures, and algorithms, you can start exploring more advanced topics such as game theory, string algorithms, and computational geometry, bit manipulation.
